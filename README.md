## Overview
The **ProDev Backend Engineering Program** is an intensive hands-on training designed to equip developers with the skills required to build scalable, secure, and production-ready backend systems.  
This repository documents my journey through the program, highlighting key learnings, challenges, and best practices.

---

## Key Technologies Covered
- **Python** – Core programming language for backend logic.
- **Django** – High-level web framework for building applications.
- **REST APIs** – Designing and implementing robust API endpoints.
- **GraphQL** – Flexible query language for APIs.
- **Docker** – Containerization and deployment of backend services.
- **CI/CD** – Automating testing and deployment pipelines.

---

## Important Backend Development Concepts
- **Database Design** – Structuring relational and non-relational databases for performance and scalability.
- **Asynchronous Programming** – Leveraging async features for efficient request handling and concurrency.
- **Caching Strategies** – Implementing Redis and in-memory caching to optimize performance.

---

## Challenges Faced and Solutions
1. **Complex Database Relationships**  
   *Solution:* Broke down models using Django ORM best practices and introduced indexing for optimization.

2. **Scaling API Performance**  
   *Solution:* Implemented query optimization, pagination, and caching mechanisms.

3. **Deployment with Docker**  
   *Solution:* Created Dockerfiles and docker-compose configurations to ensure consistent environments across development and production.

---

## Best Practices and Personal Takeaways
- Always write **clean, modular, and testable code**.
- Prioritize **security** through authentication, authorization, and input validation.
- Adopt **CI/CD pipelines** to reduce deployment risks.
- Document APIs with **Swagger/OpenAPI** for better collaboration.
- Embrace continuous learning and **debugging as part of growth**.
